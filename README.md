# goldensunvst

## goldensunvst
__goldensunvst__ is a VST plugin to play and experiment with music from the two Golden Sun games on the GBA.
It is fully compatible with MIDI and SF2 files exported with GBA Mus Ripper.
The low-level algorithms are based on __agbplay__ by ipatix.

The goal of this plugin is to offer an alternative to general soundfont plugins with the following features:
- most accurate versions of the Golden Sun specific synthesizers (thanks to ipatix disassembly work)
- Golden Sun 1&2 specific reverb effects (again, thanks to ipatix)
- Proper ADSR factors
- GBA-specific LFO which speed depends on the song BPM
- Possibility to use custom-made soundfonts with improved HQ samples
